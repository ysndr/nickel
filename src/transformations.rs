/// Share normal form.

/// Replace the subexpressions of WHNFs that are not functions by thunks, such that they can be
/// shared. It is similar to the behavior of other lazy languages with respect to data
/// constructors.  To do so, subexpressions are replaced by fresh variables, introduced by new let
/// bindings put at the beginning of the WHNF.
///
/// For example, take the expression
/// ```text
/// let x = {a = (1 + 1);} in x.a + x.a
/// ```
///
/// The term `{a = 1 + 1;}` is a record, and hence a WHNF. In consequence, the thunk allocated to x
/// is never updated. Without additional machinery, `a` will be recomputed each time is it used,
/// two times here.
///
/// The transformation replaces such subexpressions, namely the content of the fields
/// of records and the elements of lists - `(1 + 1)` in our example -, with fresh variables
/// introduced by `let`  added at the head of the term:
///
/// ```text
/// let x = (let var = 1 + 1 in {a = var;}) in x.a + x.a
/// ```
///
/// Now, the field `a` points to the thunk introduced by `var`: at the evaluation of the first
/// occurrence of `x.a`, this thunk is updated with `2`, and is not recomputed the second time.
///
/// Newly introduced variables begin with a special character to avoid clashing with user-defined
/// variables.
